qb-lockpick

Before starting, all the credits goes to the original repository [made by MaximilianAdF](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-MiniGames-4.0), I do **not** developed the UI of this resource but we only added the integration to use it on **FiveM**.
This resource is completely **standalone** so there's no required framework for this script.

```lua
exports["qb-lockpick"]:Minigame()
```
